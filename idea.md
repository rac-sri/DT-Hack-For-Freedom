"self-sustainable community hubs"

- Currently, it's called "Distributed Town" (I own this domain --> distributed.town) or SkillCheq

1. The idea is to build self-sustainable (non-sovereign) community-hubs for locals to exchange skills and tools/resources in these times of isolation. 

2. Each contributor (in skills or resources) has a unique Skill-Wallet, with the credits they have earned. 

3. Also, each community would have a "scarcity score" for each skill/resource, that will automatically send a "signal" to the closest neighborhoods when they have excess/lack of one of them. 

4. This way, near-communities can scale together by sharing the resources/skills more needed, following a "one-step random walk" model. 

5. The "skills/resources" - in order to be listed (appended) - need to be verified first, so "lying" about them wouldn't give any benefit.

6. There are different ways to verify the resources - basically we use the one-step walk approach to create a distributed network. But each interaction is on the local-base first. That means, algorithms such as Proof-of-Existence for verifying and recording new resources would work well, and can re-use existing components used in (for example) logistics, and supply & production chain.

7. As for the skills, there is a self-adjusting rating system which works in a subtractive way (starts with 100%, and can only get lower). 

(For example: 
A. you propose yourself skilled in say, gardening. 
B. I live at the floor below, and I ask you some help with gardening. 
C. You burn down all my plants
D. I give you a negative rate, and your rating gets lower.
E. The lower your rate, the lower your chances to "match" your skills with a need in the community.
Now, in order to avoid negative reviews, the people who receive help would have to place a "stake" which is adjusted to different metrics (for example: previous rates of that person's skill). If their rate is substantially different, that means they are trying to collude with the system, and the stake required would be higher.)

8. All these rate-components will determine the incentive/reward/token-amount for the person who provided the skill.

9. For the "after-COVID" - when the borders will reopen basically - people can travel across the world, and spend the "skill-wallet credits" they earned in other community-hubs
